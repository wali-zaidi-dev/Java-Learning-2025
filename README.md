# Java-Learning-2025

Welcome to the Java-Learning repository! This is a collection of Java programs and examples documenting my journey through learning Java programming.

Overview

This repository serves as a personal log and resource for the Java concepts I'm currently learning and have already learned. Here, you'll find a variety of Java code snippets, programs, and projects that illustrate different aspects of Java programming, from the basics to more advanced topics.

Repository Contents

The contents of this repository are organized by the different concepts and topics I have explored. Each directory and file is labeled accordingly to make navigation easy.

Key Topics Covered:

Basics: Simple Java programs demonstrating fundamental syntax, data types, and basic operations. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Examples and exercises on classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Collections Framework: Programs using Java's built-in data structures like Lists, Sets, Maps, and more. Exception Handling: Samples showing how to handle errors and exceptions in Java. Streams and Lambda Expressions: Modern Java programming techniques including functional programming with streams and lambda expressions.
